## Welcome to the Generative AI Study Notes Repository! 

[<img src="gallery/banner.png"/>](https://festive-chestnut-92c.notion.site/Generative-AI-Study-Notes-0f6a0129164645c5a862e6eebb2e2986)

This repository is a collection of educational materials gathered while studying generative artificial intelligence (AI). In a field that is always changing like generative AI, staying updated with key information is crucial for building skills, choosing competencies, sharing examples, and showing experimental results.

This repository is helpful for anyone who wants to learn, dive deeper, and effectively use generative AI technologies in a structured way. It covers a wide range of topics, from high-level concepts that are easy for beginners and quickly applicable, like prompting, to technical fundamentals like neural networking.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced professional, this repository aims to provide valuable resources to support your study in the world of generative AI and to share your study materials with others

üèÜ [LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard) is a crowdsourced open platform for LLM evals. They collected over 1,000,000 human pairwise comparisons to rank LLMs with the Bradley-Terry model and display the model ratings in Elo-scale. 



# Game-Changer
- [Meta‚Äôs Bizarre AI Infrastructure Choice Costs Them $100s of Millions](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither?utm_campaign=Newsletter%2B%2352&utm_content=Newsletter%2B%2349&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io) In March 2023, the open-source community gained access to Meta's LLaMA model, a powerful foundation model. Despite lacking advanced tuning and RLHF, its potential was quickly recognized, leading to rapid innovation. Within a month, significant advancements were made, including instruction tuning, quality improvements, and multimodality. Crucially, the scaling problem was solved, allowing individuals to experiment with the model using just a powerful laptop, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for training and experimentation.

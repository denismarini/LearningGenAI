    "The code to evaluate feature importance to understand the impact of each feature on the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1.Extracting Model Weights:\n",
    "  - The weights of the logistic regression model represent the importance of each feature in making predictions. These weights are stored in the model's linear layer (`model.linear.weight`).\n",
    " - You can extract the weights using `model.linear.weight.data.numpy()` and flatten the resulting tensor to get a 1D array of feature importances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Creating a DataFrame:\n",
    " - Create a pandas DataFrame with two columns: one for the feature names and the other for their corresponding importance values (i.e., the learned weights).\n",
    " - Ensure the features are aligned with their names in your dataset (e.g., `X_train.columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sorting and Plotting Feature Importance:\n",
    "  - Sort the features based on the absolute value of their importance (weights) to identify the most impactful features.\n",
    "  - Use a bar plot (via `matplotlib`) to visualize the sorted feature importances, with the feature names on the y-axis and importance values on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interpreting the Results:\n",
    "  - Larger absolute weights indicate more influential features. Positive weights suggest a positive correlation with the outcome (likely to predict the positive class), while negative weights suggest the opposite.\n",

    "#### Exercise 8:  \n",

    "Evaluate feature importance by extracting the weights of the linear layer and creating a DataFrame to display the importance of each feature. Visualize the feature importance using a bar plot.  \n"

    "Congratulations on completing the project! In this final project, you built a logistic regression model to predict the outcomes of League of Legends matches based on various in-game statistics. This comprehensive project involved several key steps, including data loading and preprocessing, model implementation, training, optimization, evaluation, visualization, model saving and loading, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis. This project provided hands-on experience with the complete workflow of developing a machine learning model for binary classification tasks using PyTorch.\n",
